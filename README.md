# Chess
My newest iteration of my 3-year chess project. It comes with a AI Engine, a socket network (for LAN play), and AES Encryption. Currently, I'm working on the FastAI folder to make my AI faster by using bitboards instead of objects.

I kinda feel a little bad because after I created my AI search algorithms, I found even better ones online.
